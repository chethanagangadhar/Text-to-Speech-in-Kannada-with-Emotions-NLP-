# Text-to-Speech-in-Kannada-with-Emotions-NLP
Project Description
This project aims to convert Kannada text into speech with human-like tonal qualities characterized by various emotions, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals and those with learning disabilities. The project is particularly designed to make online content more accessible and relatable by adding emotional depth to the speech output.

Methodology
Emotion Prediction: Uses Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Decision Tree (DT) models to predict the emotional tone in the text, allowing the TTS output to be tailored to express appropriate emotions.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Utilizes Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and PyDub for converting the processed Kannada text into speech, ensuring clarity and high-quality sound output.


Tools & Libraries
Machine Learning Models: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Decision Tree (DT)
Text-to-Speech Libraries: gTTS, PyDub
This project highlights the integration of natural language processing (NLP) techniques with text-to-speech technology, aiming to deliver a robust tool for Kannada language accessibility.
